###### This app has been a game changer for my junior tennis player. Our daughter is what many would consider a perfectionist and she loves everything about tennis.  We look forward to continuing with the app and will also consider taking 1:1 coaching from their awesome staff.

###### I think the meditation needs to be slowed down when the speaker is talking. I can't really do the activities they ask me to do because they are running the the task.

###### Apeak is a tremendous app to help you drastically improve your tennis game! I have only used Apeak for a short period of time but I can already tell how it is has helped me. With the visualization training it helps me get in the right mindset before practice and during practice when I start to deal with adversity I remember what I heard from the visualization I listened to before practice.

###### Before using Apeak Tennis, the mental aspect of my tennis game was barely accounted for. I realized I was only working on my game on the tennis court or doing fitness and that the mental side of my training was extremely undervalued. Between points, I was struggling to control my emotions and wanted to find a way to give myself an edge over my opponents.

###### With the help of Apeak I’ve been able to focus on the right things while on the tennis court. I’ve only used this app for a short period of time and recently played a tournament while completing the training exercises. In the matches I found myself in difficult situations and with the help of being reminded to focus on the right things while playing.

###### I’ve been using this app for the last couple weeks and it is phenomenal. The app takes feedback from your game, then gives you mental training sessions specifically tailored for your game, addressing your weaknesses and helping you overcome them. It has improved my mental toughness, not only for tennis, but in my day job.

###### This app gave me everything I needed to become a better tennis player and bring my game to the next level. Visualization opens the door to prepare me for matches before I even hit the first ball during the warm-up. This app makes it simple, easy, and accessible for all to be able to take advantage of crucial parts of competitive athletics.

###### I really enjoy this app. It has really helped me improve my mental game. I regularly play national senior tournaments and it has help me prepare for matches and improve my practices during the week. Look forward to newer versions as the app continues to improve.

###### Great app that really helped me understand better about my mental weaknesses and taking my game to the next level. I recommend this app to anyone of any skill level that is looking for a mental edge during competition and practice.

###### This is pretty interesting app. I have been using it for couple of days. I feel great about learning how to think and gives me feedback each day depend on how i played. I am starting to play little better. I like this. Really cool

###### It took me a little bit to build Apeak training into my process, but I'm so happy I stuck with it. It's been invaluable to getting me to build especially my visualization practice and process. I've become calmer and more focused on court as a result.

###### Hi there wanted to comment as a coach of over 25 years and a former professional this is a great tool to help players improve there on court performance. This App is great for helping players improve while not being on court and with the use of it, it helps impact improvement. Figures why professionals have used mental, visual and meditation for ever to gain real gains in pressure....

###### Apeak is a tremendous app to help you drastically improve your tennis game! I have only used Apeak for a short period of time but I can already tell how it is has helped me. With the visualization training it helps me get in the right mindset before practice and during practice when I start to deal with adversity I remember what I heard from the visualization I listened to before practice.

###### Before using Apeak Tennis, the mental aspect of my tennis game was barely accounted for. I realized I was only working on my game on the tennis court or doing fitness and that the mental side of my training was extremely undervalued. Between points, I was struggling to control my emotions and wanted to find a way to give myself an edge over my opponents.

###### With the help of Apeak I’ve been able to focus on the right things while on the tennis court. I’ve only used this app for a short period of time and recently played a tournament while completing the training exercises. In the matches I found myself in difficult situations and with the help of being reminded to focus on the right things while playing.

###### I’ve been using this app for the last couple weeks and it is phenomenal. The app takes feedback from your game, then gives you mental training sessions specifically tailored for your game, addressing your weaknesses and helping you overcome them. It has improved my mental toughness, not only for tennis, but in my day job.

###### This app gave me everything I needed to become a better tennis player and bring my game to the next level. Visualization opens the door to prepare me for matches before I even hit the first ball during the warm-up. This app makes it simple, easy, and accessible for all to be able to take advantage of crucial parts of competitive athletics.

###### I really enjoy this app. It has really helped me improve my mental game. I regularly play national senior tournaments and it has help me prepare for matches and improve my practices during the week. Look forward to newer versions as the app continues to improve.

###### Great app that really helped me understand better about my mental weaknesses and taking my game to the next level. I recommend this app to anyone of any skill level that is looking for a mental edge during competition and practice.

###### Actively using and learning from the Apeak app as well as participating in one on one lessons, has given me the opportunity to align my life goals with my tennis goals. And has flourished the ability to control my emotions on the court.

###### I had terrible match anxiety and nerves before. With the Apeak Mentorship Program, my coach Will helped me work through those nerves and negative thoughts. I’m truly grateful to him and the visualizations in the app for making me a better player.

###### This is revised from a 2 star to a 5 star. That app was initially not working for me at all, but still looked really nice. I reached out to the feedback and support team and they were incredibly responsive and ultimately fixed the issue. The app now works great and I would give a 6th star just because of the Apeak team and customer service.

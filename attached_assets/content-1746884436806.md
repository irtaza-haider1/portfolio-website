### Great produce and communication

Great produce! I've been getting the medium variety box for a few weeks now, and it perfectly meets all our fruit and veg needs for a family of four each week. Deliveries have always been on time, and the communication has been fantastic. I highly recommend this service ‚Äî not to mention the added bonus of relying less on the big supermarkets!

### Good value + more than just fruit and veg

Good value on fruit+veg boxes. You can also buy bread, nuts, longlife milks, chips, some canned goods.

My absolute favourite from it all, though, was the granola. Best granola I've ever had!

### Fresh produce delivered even after a cyclone

Thanks for delivering fresh food to my door even after the recent cyclone, rain and flooding. We have found ordering our selection of items via the funky food online store the best for us. This means that based on what is in season and what we eat we can go into the store and order from the selection. We mostly order our base staple veggies, salad items and some fruit. We still like to self select fresh fruit ourselves elsewhere, but often get great melons, passionfruit and grapes and other seasonal fruit in our box. It is convenient and fresh easy to pause or cancel if needed and communication has always been prompt and professional. Thanks

### Beautifully packaged and boxed

Beautifully packaged and boxed. It was delivered and left with care. The fruit and veggies were not damaged. Everything was crisp and fresh. I feel special as I was checked on for feedback. Most companies don‚Äôt do this. I highly recommend this company as not only are you helping to reduce the carbon footprint you can save your time on other aspects of your life. Well done guys. Keep up the good work. I will be back again and again. Thank you.

### Loved our first box!

Loved our first box! I was so surprised at how much produce we received for the price we paid. Everything was fresh and will last us the week. Delivery was really easy too as they kept us updated on the time we would receive it.
